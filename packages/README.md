## roman
The roman package registers 1000 Roman numerals to be accessed programmatically.
The syntax is `\[ROMANx]` where `x` is your number of choice.
This Package is used in default.mom.

## chicago
Package here for redundancy, see [chicago-refer](https://github.com/user18130814200115-2/chicago-refer).
This Package is used in `om`.
The .R1 .R2 block cannot be sourced though, it must be actually included in the final compiled document.

## list
This package allows for making easier bulleted lists with `mom`.
The syntax is simple, use `.>` for the first level `.>>` for the second and so forth.
The limit is currently set to 9 indented lists, though this is a variable you can change in the file.

## dropcap
There are references to a dropcap macro, I did not make this myself.
It can be found [here](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2005-03/msg00133.html)
